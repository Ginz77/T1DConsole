# T1DConsole

Created a simple console application to calculate my sons Type 1 Diabetes.

1: Set the values to make the needed adjustments:

Carb Ratio
(e.g. carbRatioVal = 22)

Target Blood Sugar
(e.g. TargetBloodSugarVal = 120)

Correction Factor
(e.g. CorrectionFactorVal = 80)

2: Run the application to enter carbs and blood sugar at user inputs to get total units of insulin to be administered.
