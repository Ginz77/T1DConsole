# T1DConsole

Created a simple console application to calculate my sons Type 1 Diabetes.

How to use:

1: Set the values to make the needed adjustments:

Carb Ratio
(i.e. carbRatioVal = 15)

Target Blood Sugar
(i.e. TargetBloodSugarVal = 120)

Correction Factor
(i.e. CorrectionFactorVal = 80)

2: Run the application to enter carbs and blood sugar at user inputs to get total units of insulin to be administered.
